# Implosion
## Don't mind me, i'm just playing around

This is just a small project i decieded to start in my spare time to leave my comfort zone with the stack I already know: Java/Seam/Primefaces/JSF and move onto a newer Java/Spring/Vue.js

## So far i've been
- Playing around with Springboot: It's features are quite similar to what i'm used to, so its ok.
- Vue.js is a new thing, will get used to it.
- Overusing patterns, I know, but its a show off code, not gonna lie, I don't mind taking couple days more doing things right
